# 3D Image Linear Transformer

In computer graphics, an object is usually represented by dividing its surface into a set of polygons called 'faces'. A set of faces is called a mesh.

In linear algebra, Linear Transformations can be used to redirect and alter graphical elements (such as vectors and matrices) within a Vector Space.

Conveniently, every valid Linear Transformation T: V -> W (where V and W are vector spaces) can be defined as a matrix A of size dim(W) x dim(V) (where dim(V) and dim(W) represent the dimensions of the Vector Spaces V and W, respectively).

From this knowledge, we can take graphical elements such as vertices, polygons and meshes and apply any desired Linear Transformation with the use of matrix algebra. To illustrate an example, we could take a vertex **v** = (Vx, Vy, Vz) and rotate it about the x axis by ùúÉ degrees with the 3x3 Matrix:

Such that **v** would then be transformed into:

In this program, I've defined each mesh as a set of polygons and each polygon as a set of vertices. In total, I have defined exactly six classes and two interfaces in their respective files (i.e. the Vertex class is in the Vertex.java file).

They are defined as follows:

**1.) GraphicalObject** - An abstract class that represents graphical objects (such as vertices and polygons) that can be transformed using a matrix. It has the following void methods:

    a.) transform: an abstract method that takes a two-dimensional matrix of type double as its only parameter.
    b.) rotateXAxis:
